# gcForest 
Status : under development

This code contains a direct implentation of the gcForest algorithm as suggested in Zhou and Feng 2017.

The syntax uses the scikit learn style with a .fit() function to train the algorithm and a .predict() function to predict new values class.

So far it only works as a Classifier and does not include the following :
- No parallelisation of the code has been done yet

Note that I wrote the code from scratch in two days and even though I have tested it on several cases I cannot certify that it is a 100% bug free.
Feel free to test it and/or suggest any improvement!
